# CDK-learning-series
A learning series talk on my experience building infrastructure with AWS CDK

## Part 1: How it works

### Project Structure
```
.
|-- cdk.json // The configuration settings of the application:
|-- src
|   `-- bin
|       `-- cdk.ts // The entry point of your CDK application 
|-- tsconfig.base.json // Provides the typescript rules for the project.
`-- tsconfig.json // Extends `typescript.base.json` to use project rules and applies it to a src location
```

### Deploying a CDK app
When invoking `cdk deploy` in the command line. The CLI will use the features defined in your `cdk.json` under `context` you can learn more about [here](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/master/packages/@aws-cdk/cx-api/lib/features.ts)
The CDK will invoke the command that is defined on the `app` property in our case using `ts-node` as an executable to run our cdk app located at the entry point
`src/bin/cdk.ts`. It will deploy by using your aws credentials located in `~/.aws/credentials` 

#### Bootstrapping

This process only occurs under certain criteria depending on where this application
is being deployed to. You can find out more about this [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/bootstrapping.html)

#### Output
You will notice a `cdk.out` directory that is created when running `cdk deploy`. This is the cloud formation templates that are generated as part of this workflow
We have created a LearningSeriesStack, which will hold the scope of our Cloudformation constructs

## Part 2: CDK Constructs

### Application (App)
The root of our CDK application. This is the construct that drives the
creation in this of a single LearningSeriesStack that encapsulates the constructs within it

### Stack (LearningSeriesStack)
The LearningSeriesStack is where we define the initial constructs that make up the components
of the CDK app. 

### Constructs (SrcRepository, BuildProject)
The Stack has two constructs a src repository, and a build project.  The code commit source repository feeds into the
build project in order to do work against it.

### Stack Encapsulation
In order for a stack to hold ownership of constructs. It needs to know the context in which these constructs are created.
The CDK does this by accepting a scope (`this`) argument as the first parameter to each construct. This is a ubiquitous trait of all classes
that extend the Construct class.

## Part 3: Adding a pipeline
In Part 2 we created two CDK constructs. A repository and a BuildProject in order to show how a Stack encapsulates
constructs you put within it but it's not very useful. The repository is empty, and we didn't give codebuild a
way to do anything with that repository. In order to make this more useful we'll add a pipeline to handle the orchestration
of triggering a run so that we may feed src code changes into a buildProject to do work. Our stack will now
look something like this.

![Stack in the console](docs/project-with-constructs-pipeline.png)

However, there is another problem. We need to initialize our repository with code. Declarative expressing using the CDK is currently not
possible. (At least not that I know of). So this project is fitted with a script in order to initialize a code commit repository which
is then used in our CDK Stack through `Repository.fromRepositoryName` you can run this script as follows `sh ./scripts/init`

### Construct Types:

Now is a good time to talk about the construct types. Constructs can offer be referred to by L1, L2, and L3 this is a discription given
to set the expectations of scope for a construct. For example L1 constructs are exactly the resources defined by AWS CloudFormationâ€”no more, no less.
L2 level constructs are what we have been operating with, they are higher levels of abstraction that typically provide sensible defaults
to L1 constructs in order to do something typical.

## Part 4: Changing the pipeline to use the CDKPipeline construct
The CDK pipeline is a higher level of abstraction over the earlier pipeline construct. It offers the ability to rebuild
your infrastructure using the `synthAction` property. Where as before we were manually running cdk deploy in our terminal.

![Stages](docs/cdkpipeline-stages.png)

`SimpleSynthAction.standardNpmSynth` adds the following 2 stages in our pipeline. We have also created a new artifact called
`cloudAssemblyArtifact`. Remember in part one we spoke about the cdk.out directory. This artifact is used to capture these templates when we `synth` 
so that the pipeline may re-deploy our new infra changes, when changes are detected.
